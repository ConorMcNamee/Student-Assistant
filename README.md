# Student Assistant App

I had the idea for this app while using other Note taking app / Productivity apps and felt they didn't really suit me so I decided to make my own, that would fit my needs.
The finished product will include:
  - Note Taking App
  - Folder system to organise your notes effectively
  - Scheduling App / Calendar App
  - Todo list / Assignment list

## The App is written in:

  - Python (Django and Django REST framework)
  - React (Typescript)
  - Soon to add mongoDB database
